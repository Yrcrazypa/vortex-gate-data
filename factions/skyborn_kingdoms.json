  "lore": "In the beginning, when the cosmos were still young and the stars twinkled with the promise of new worlds, a divine being known as the Celestial Weaver was entrusted with the task of creating a planet that would become a haven for mortal beings. With great skill and artistry, the Weaver wove together threads of magic, elemental forces, and ethereal energies to bring forth a celestial sphere of wonder and beauty.\n\nUpon this newly formed planet, the Celestial Weaver bestowed a gift to its inhabitants - the essence of the skies itself. These mortal beings, who became known as the Skyborn, possessed a unique connection to the heavens above. Their very souls were intertwined with the celestial energies that flowed through the planet, granting them extraordinary abilities, such as the power to manipulate air, harness the energy of stars, and even commune with celestial beings.\n\nAs the Skyborn civilizations flourished and grew, they formed feudal human kingdoms, each ruled by noble families with inherited control over specific aspects of the skies. Some kingdoms became masters of wind and flight, dwelling in cities suspended among the clouds. Others wielded the power of lightning and thunder, using their prowess to protect their lands from outside threats. Some Skyborn kingdoms devoted themselves to the study of stars and celestial navigation, guiding travelers across the vast expanses of the world.\n\nHowever, with the passing of time, envy and ambition tainted the hearts of some Skyborn rulers. The desire for dominance and control over the celestial energies led to conflicts and wars among the kingdoms. Skies once filled with harmonious magic were now marred by the clashing of powerful spells and the clash of mighty armies.\n\nDuring this age of strife, a prophecy emerged from the sacred texts of an ancient Skyborn order. It spoke of a chosen one, a fabled Starweaver, destined to rise from humble beginnings and unite the fractured kingdoms. Only the Starweaver possessed the ability to hear the true voice of the Celestial Weaver and bring harmony back to the skies.\n\nIn the heart of this turmoil, a young and unsuspecting individual emerged from an overlooked corner of the world. They possessed a unique gift - the ability to absorb and channel multiple celestial energies, a feat unheard of in the history of the Skyborn. This person, whose true name was lost to time, became known as the "Unbound."\n\nGuided by visions and whispers from the stars, the Unbound set out on a journey to unite the feuding kingdoms and restore balance to the celestial energies. Along the way, they encountered challenges, forged alliances, and unraveled the secrets of the long-forgotten past. They learned that true power lay not in domination, but in unity and understanding.\n\nAs the Unbound's influence spread, the feudal human kingdoms began to lay down their arms and embrace the ideals of harmony and cooperation. With the guidance of the Starweaver, they established a new era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe planet of feudal human kingdoms, home to the Skyborn, became a beacon of hope and wisdom among the stars. The once warring kingdoms now stood together, their people united under a shared destiny, and their skies danced with magic and beauty once more. And so, the legacy of the Skyborn endured, a testament to the power of mortal beings who wielded the essence of the heavens.",

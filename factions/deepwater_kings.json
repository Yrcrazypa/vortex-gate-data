  "lore": "\n\nIn ages long past, within the ancient elven kingdom of Elenoria, a group of ambitious and power-hungry elves delved deep into the forbidden arts of necromancy. These renegade elves were known as the Darkweavers, and under their dark influence, they sought to wield power over life and death, defying the natural order of the world.\n\nAs the corruption of necromancy spread through their ranks, it became clear to the ruling council of Elenoria that decisive action was needed to prevent the malevolent practices from consuming their society entirely. The council, led by the wise and compassionate High King Alarion, reluctantly made the decision to banish the Darkweavers and their followers from their ancestral homeland.\n\nThus, the Deepwater Kings were born â€“ a race of elves cast out from the lush forests and shining cities of Elenoria, condemned to exile beneath the ocean's depths. High King Alarion invoked ancient and powerful magic, creating a massive chasm in the ocean floor that swallowed the renegades' city whole, submerging it beneath the waves. The dark waters flooded into the once-thriving city, sealing the fate of the Darkweavers and their followers.\n\nCondemned to the watery depths, the exiled elves found themselves transformed by their forced isolation and the potent magic swirling around them. Over time, their once-pale skin adapted to the depths, taking on a faintly luminescent hue that allowed them to see in the darkest ocean depths. Their eyes, now reflecting the bioluminescent beauty of the sea, adjusted to the lack of light and gained the ability to perceive the tiniest movements in the water.\n\nAs the elves adapted to their new underwater existence, they discovered hidden underwater caverns and ancient ruins where they could rebuild their society. They forged a new civilization, embracing the magic of the ocean and harmonizing with its creatures. The Deepwater Kings became skilled in controlling the currents, harnessing the power of the tides, and communicating with the sea's denizens.\n\nThough they were initially tainted by the darkness of necromancy, the centuries of exile led them to seek redemption and forge a new path. They vowed never again to dabble in forbidden arts and instead embraced the elemental magic of water and life. They became protectors of the ocean's balance, defending it from any threats that arose and striving to maintain the delicate harmony of the undersea world.\n\nAs time passed, the Deepwater Kings honed their abilities and became a formidable force, both in water and on land. Their banishment, though a punishment, had transformed them into a new race of elves, uniquely connected to the sea and its mysteries. They became known as wise and compassionate beings, harboring a deep respect for life and death, having learned firsthand the consequences of wielding power recklessly.\n\nThus, the Deepwater Kings now stand as guardians of the ocean's secrets, seeking to restore their honor and prove to the world that they are more than their dark past. Their story serves as a reminder that even from the darkest depths of exile, redemption and rebirth are possible.",

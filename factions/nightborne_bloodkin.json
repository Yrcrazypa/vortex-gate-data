  "lore": "In the distant reaches of the cosmos, there exists a mysterious and haunting planet known as Nocturnia. Bathed in perpetual darkness, this celestial body orbits a dying star, its landscape shrouded in a perpetual twilight. Nocturnia is a world of eternal night, where the sun's feeble glow barely reaches the surface.\n\nOn this desolate planet, a civilization of immortal beings known as the Nightborne Bloodkin has thrived for millennia. The Nightborne Bloodkin are a proud and ancient race with an insatiable thirst for the essence of life itself. Their origins trace back to a distant age when a cataclysmic event on their home world forced them to seek refuge on Nocturnia.\n\nLong ago, their ancestors were a prosperous and advanced civilization on a distant planet, rich in arcane knowledge and magical prowess. Their society was once a beacon of enlightenment and harmony with nature. However, their thirst for power and forbidden magic led to their downfall. A powerful cataclysm, a conjuring gone awry, ripped through their world, threatening all life.\n\nDesperate to escape the devastation, a group of mages performed a daring and dangerous ritual, opening a rift in space that transported them and their kin to Nocturnia. Unbeknownst to them, this dark ritual forever altered their essence, granting them immortality but chaining them to an unquenchable hunger for the life force of other beings.\n\nAs they arrived on Nocturnia, they found themselves in a world vastly different from their original home. The planet's permanent darkness allowed them to thrive, and they adapted to their new environment with remarkable swiftness. They developed exceptional night vision, keen senses, and heightened strength. With time, they discovered that their very existence relied on the consumption of the life essence, blood, or psychic energy of other creatures.\n\nThe Nightborne Bloodkin established their dominion across Nocturnia, constructing grand citadels and castles within the shadowy landscapes. They forged a society steeped in ancient traditions and rituals, governed by a council of the oldest and most powerful among them.\n\nOver the centuries, the Nightborne Bloodkin honed their dark arts and refined their control over their primal instincts. They developed a code of conduct that dictated their interactions with both their own kind and other beings that wandered into their domain. While some embraced their predatory nature without remorse, others sought ways to limit their consumption of life essence or found alternatives to sustain themselves.\n\nDespite their immortal existence, the Nightborne Bloodkin often wrestled with the weight of time and the consequences of their choices. Some among them grappled with guilt for the actions of their ancestors, while others yearned for a connection to the world they once called home.\n\nAs the eons passed, the Nightborne Bloodkin continued to be enigmatic and feared figures in the cosmos, shrouded in legends and folklore. They guarded their secrets fiercely, rarely venturing beyond Nocturnia's boundaries. Their civilization remained an enduring enigma, as they contemplated the legacy of their past and sought to find balance between their undying thirst for life essence and the potential for redemption and understanding.\n\nOn Nocturnia, the eternal twilight serves as a constant reminder of the duality of their existence - a civilization of immortal beings forever bound to the darkness, grappling with both their innate hunger and their yearning for something more.",
